Richard is a continual fiddler with small open source projects, and a 
passionate advocate for open source projects. He studied linguistics and
thinks about helping under-resourced and endangered languages most often,
but also brainstorms ways of opening up academia and building communities.
He mainly works in javascript and emails.
