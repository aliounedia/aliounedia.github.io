Ricardo is a hacker and designer who has been busy tinkering with F/LOSS tools,
as well as making a few. He spends an unhealthy amount of evenings writing code
(mostly Python) for projects ranging from vector design hacks to data gobbling
scrapers. Co-founded and coordinates the activities of TransparÃªncia Hackday
Portugal, the Porto-based open data collective.
